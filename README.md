# Neighborhood Map Project
Source code for the Neighborhood Map project (5.1)

## Installation

### Step 1
  Download the following repository: https://github.com/slhussey/neighborhood-map

`$ git clone https://github.com/slhussey/neighborhood-map.git`

### Step 2
  Apply for and acquire a Google developer API key to use.

### Step 3
  Apply for and acquire a Zillow developer API key to use.

### Step 4
  Update the API key for Google Maps in the index.html file line 29 to use your API key.

### Step 5
  Update the API key for Zillow in the octopus.js file line 191 to use your API key.

### Step 6
  Launch your favorite web browser and then open the index.html file that was
  just downloaded.  If you want the API tp Zillow to work, you will need to use Internet
  Explorer on Windows.  Not sure if Safari on Mac OS X works or not.  This is due to 
  cross site scripting prevention measures on the Zillow API servers.
